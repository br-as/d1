										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Soccer has overturned a ban on football players kneeling during the national anthem.</p>
<p>The rule was introduced in 2016 after women&#8217;s star Megan Rapinoe kneeled in solidarity with ex-NFL player Colin Kaepernick, who began kneeling during the anthem in protest against racial injustice.</p>
<p>The US Soccer board described its previous stance as &#8220;wrong&#8221;.</p>
<p>The move comes amid worldwide protests over the death of George Floyd.</p>
<p>Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in police custody in Minneapolis last month. His death has brought a renewed focus to the issue of racism and police brutality.</p>
<p>&#8216;We were wrong&#8217;: NFL to allow players&#8217; protest<br />
In a statement, the US Soccer Federation said taking a knee was a form of protest against &#8220;police brutality and the systematic oppression of Black people and people of colour in America&#8221;.</p>

The U.S. Soccer Board of Directors voted yesterday to repeal Policy 604-1, which required our players to stand during the national anthem.</p>

The decision to ban the gesture, it went on to say, &#8220;was wrong and detracted from the important message of Black Lives Matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Saturday, the National Football League (NFL) overturned its own ban on players kneeling.</p>
<p>Taking a knee has been used in many protests since Floyd&#8217;s death.</p>

NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick began kneeling at the start of matches in 2016, saying at the time: &#8220;I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of colour.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was later joined by a number of other players, before the NFL introduced a rule &#8211; later repealed &#8211; that teams would be fined if players refused to stand for the anthem.</p>

Kaepernick became a free agent after the 2016 season but remains unsigned. Kaepernick filed a grievance against NFL owners in October 2017, believing they were conspiring not to hire him because of his kneeling protests.</p>
<p>The two sides resolved the grievance in February under a confidentiality agreement.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for players who kneel to be fired</p>
